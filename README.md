Screen Shot
Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional, but great for setting up your portfolio).

Remove this section if unused.

Documentation
Link to a read-only version of your scope document or other relevant documentation here (optional). Remove if unused.

Next Steps
This section is great to show that you can scope & prioritize. For weekend challenges, if you didn't get to stretch, you could list those here & consider coming back to them if/when you have some extra time (even post graduation).

Features that you would like to add at some point in the future.

 Feature c
Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

For early projects (week 1), this might mention GitHub Pages. For later projects this will be Heroku (or something similar) which we will talk about in week 3. This should be similar for most of our projects, so write once and edit/re-use.
